@example
#include <stdio.h>
int fgetc(FILE *@var{fp});

#define _BSD_SOURCE
#include <stdio.h>
int fgetc_unlocked(FILE *@var{fp});

#include <stdio.h>
int _fgetc_r(struct _reent *@var{ptr}, FILE *@var{fp});

#define _BSD_SOURCE
#include <stdio.h>
int _fgetc_unlocked_r(struct _reent *@var{ptr}, FILE *@var{fp});

@strong{Description}@*
Use @code{fgetc} to get the next single character from the file or stream
identified by @var{fp}.  As a side effect, @code{fgetc} advances the file's
current position indicator.

For a macro version of this function, see @code{getc}.

@code{fgetc_unlocked} is a non-thread-safe version of @code{fgetc}.
@code{fgetc_unlocked} may only safely be used within a scope
protected by flockfile() (or ftrylockfile()) and funlockfile().  This
function may safely be used in a multi-threaded program if and only
if they are called while the invoking thread owns the (FILE *)
object, as is the case after a successful call to the flockfile() or
ftrylockfile() functions.  If threads are disabled, then
@code{fgetc_unlocked} is equivalent to @code{fgetc}.

The functions @code{_fgetc_r} and @code{_fgetc_unlocked_r} are simply reentrant
versions that are passed the additional reentrant structure pointer
argument: @var{ptr}.

@*
@strong{Returns}@*
The next character (read as an @code{unsigned char}, and cast to
@code{int}), unless there is no more data, or the host system reports a
read error; in either of these situations, @code{fgetc} returns @code{EOF}.

You can distinguish the two situations that cause an @code{EOF} result by
using the @code{ferror} and @code{feof} functions.

@*
@strong{Portability}@*
ANSI C requires @code{fgetc}.

@code{fgetc_unlocked} is a BSD extension also provided by GNU libc.

Supporting OS subroutines required: @code{close}, @code{fstat}, @code{isatty},
@code{lseek}, @code{read}, @code{sbrk}, @code{write}.

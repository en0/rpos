@strong{Synopsis}
@example
#include <stdio.h>
char *fgets(char *restrict @var{buf}, int @var{n}, FILE *restrict @var{fp});

#define _GNU_SOURCE
#include <stdio.h>
char *fgets_unlocked(char *restrict @var{buf}, int @var{n}, FILE *restrict @var{fp});

#include <stdio.h>
char *_fgets_r(struct _reent *@var{ptr}, char *restrict @var{buf}, int @var{n}, FILE *restrict @var{fp});

#include <stdio.h>
char *_fgets_unlocked_r(struct _reent *@var{ptr}, char *restrict @var{buf}, int @var{n}, FILE *restrict @var{fp});

@end example
@strong{Description}@*
Reads at most @var{n-1} characters from @var{fp} until a newline
is found. The characters including to the newline are stored
in @var{buf}. The buffer is terminated with a 0.

@code{fgets_unlocked} is a non-thread-safe version of @code{fgets}.
@code{fgets_unlocked} may only safely be used within a scope
protected by flockfile() (or ftrylockfile()) and funlockfile().  This
function may safely be used in a multi-threaded program if and only
if they are called while the invoking thread owns the (FILE *)
object, as is the case after a successful call to the flockfile() or
ftrylockfile() functions.  If threads are disabled, then
@code{fgets_unlocked} is equivalent to @code{fgets}.

The functions @code{_fgets_r} and @code{_fgets_unlocked_r} are simply
reentrant versions that are passed the additional reentrant structure
pointer argument: @var{ptr}.

@*
@strong{Returns}@*
@code{fgets} returns the buffer passed to it, with the data
filled in. If end of file occurs with some data already
accumulated, the data is returned with no other indication. If
no data are read, NULL is returned instead.

@*
@strong{Portability}@*
@code{fgets} should replace all uses of @code{gets}. Note however
that @code{fgets} returns all of the data, while @code{gets} removes
the trailing newline (with no indication that it has done so.)

@code{fgets_unlocked} is a GNU extension.

Supporting OS subroutines required: @code{close}, @code{fstat}, @code{isatty},
@code{lseek}, @code{read}, @code{sbrk}, @code{write}.
